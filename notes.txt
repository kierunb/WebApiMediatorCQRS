CQRS - definition

- CQRS stands for Command and Query Responsibility Segregation, a pattern that separates read and update operations for a data store. 
- Implementing CQRS in your application can maximize its performance, scalability, and security. 
- The flexibility created by migrating to CQRS allows a system to better evolve over time and prevents update commands from causing merge conflicts at the domain level.
- CQRS is a simple pattern – two objects for command/queries where once there was one.
